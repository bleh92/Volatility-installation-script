# Volatility-installation-script
A simple script which automates the process of installing volatility. There still some changes which can be done. Will improve the script as my skill level goes up.


Now before you start running the script, there are a few prerequisites I need you to follow.

First- Take a snapshot of your current machine, i.e before running the script.
Second - I couldnt figure out how to make and run a python2.7 env through scripting. So I wnat you to run these following commands and then download and run the script.
        ```virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 vol   (you can give any name for the directory, but for now I am going to vol as my directory name)
        source vol/bin/activate```

After  this you can jump into the vol directory and download and run the script from there.
Make sure to give necessary permissions to run the script that is (chmod +x install.sh)


Also make sure to run the script as root.


Happy hacking!!!
